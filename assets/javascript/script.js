// could probably do the light mode and dark mode here

// First, one must set a variable connected to an html element with the following syntax - this is for the item to be clicked - in this instance, i chose a button with an id that will be consistent across my html files
const lightModeDarkMode = document.querySelector(`#dark-mode-button`)

// Next, the entirety of the page needs to be changed after the click occurs
const container = document.querySelector(`.container`)

// Next, one must setup a function that listens for a class and with the lass then implements a new style. It would seem i jsut setup the style in css?



// now use the variable to add an event listener of click and run a function with the following parameters
