  <!-- so for this one, i think all i need to do is inlude a link to the javascript file and with that it will be the thing to create the elements on this page once things are entered on the landing page. I am wondering if i need to style things with javascript or if after the elements are created i will be abel to style them with css.
   -->
   <!-- Things i will need: Name, Title, and post-content. Those are in the local data. I should be able to pull them from the local data and then assign an element with the value of the given data. this will require a get. I will need a variable in js to rep the value of the data. I believe i can assign id's to html elements created in js. That should make it possible to style tings after theyre created.  -->
